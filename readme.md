This is an in-progress, modular auto-rigger being used in the BYU Class of 2025 animation capstone.

## Todo

Hands
- Hand and finger attributes (fist, cup, spread, individual finger curl). Add a 2D control to drive SDKs on fist/cup/spread. **in progress**

Head
- <s>Create a script to connect head to body</s>
- Confirm that this always works in Unreal, or figure out a full head transplant

Notes from anim
- give position control to utility control group (low/med priority)
- Verify extreme arm poses. Some reports of "glitchiness" when arms are raised up or back, particularly in bendy controls.
- FK neck, similar to spine (high priority)
- Something about the foot floating away when changing roll max. Can't replicate, but will chase down a better report.
- Another foot pivot control located exactly between the in/out pivots (med priority)
- Bendy elbows (low priority)
- Make sure that thumbs mirror behavior in both rigs
